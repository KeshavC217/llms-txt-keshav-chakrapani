# llms.txt Generator

**Live: <https://llms-txt-keshav-chakrapani.vercel.app>**

A tool that generates an [`llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org) file for a website.

Right now it is a **passthrough**: you enter a URL, the server fetches it, and the response body
comes back verbatim for preview and download. There is no crawling, no extraction and no
generation yet — this is the starting point, being built up deliberately from here.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and enter a URL.

## How it works

```
app/
  page.tsx               URL input, result preview, download
  api/generate/route.ts  POST { url } -> fetch -> { llmsTxt, status, contentType }
```

`POST /api/generate` takes `{ "url": "example.com" }` and returns:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "status": 200,
  "contentType": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
  "truncated": false,
  "llmsTxt": "<!doctype html>..."
}
```

The URL is normalized first (a bare hostname gets `https://`; a non-http scheme is rejected
rather than defaulted, since prefixing `https://` onto `ftp://example.com` produces
`https://ftp://example.com`, which `URL` happily parses with the host `ftp`).

Responses are capped at 2 MB and the fetch times out after 15s.

### The one guard

`assertPublicUrl` refuses URLs resolving to a loopback, link-local, private or CGNAT address,
and re-checks the final URL after redirects.

This is deliberate rather than left over. The endpoint fetches a user-supplied URL server-side
and returns the body, so without it the deployed app is an open proxy into anything the function
can reach — `http://169.254.169.254/` (cloud instance metadata) included. A public URL can also
`302` into the private range, which is why the post-redirect check exists.

Set `ALLOW_PRIVATE_CRAWL_TARGETS=1` to bypass it when testing against a local server.

## Environment

Nothing is required to run the passthrough. `.env.example` documents the variables the fuller
version will use as it gets rebuilt (Supabase for persistence, OpenRouter for an LLM pass, a cron
secret for scheduled updates).

## Deployment

Deployed to Vercel as a standard Next.js app; `vercel deploy --prod` from the project root.

## History

The full implementation — crawler with sitemap/robots/nav parsing, headless-browser fallback for
JS-rendered pages, deterministic sectioning, a constrained LLM copyedit pass, Supabase
persistence, change detection and scheduled re-crawls — is preserved at the tag
[`v1-full-generator`](https://github.com/KeshavC217/llms-txt-keshav-chakrapani/releases/tag/v1-full-generator).

```bash
git show v1-full-generator:lib/crawler.ts   # read a file from it
git diff v1-full-generator                  # what was removed
```
